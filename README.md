# BERT Part of Speech Classifier
This is a small personal project following the Tensorflow Tutorial on how to use BERT to make a sentiment classifier. I wanted to learn about BERT so I could use it on my own in other personal projects as well as understand why it is so much more effective than anything I can make by hand. Additionally, I am learning about transfer learning (using another model trained on one task to accomplish another task) and seeing how effective it can be. I am extremely interested in how we work with text data with machine learning as it differs from the traditional mode of numeric data input, so I am using this to start learning about the different methods of handling text.
